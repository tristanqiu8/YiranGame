## 📋 System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version**: 3.7+
- **Display**: Minimum 1400x900 resolution recommended
- **Memory**: 512MB RAM minimum
- **Graphics**: Any graphics card that supports basic 2D rendering

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"pygame not found" error**
   - Make sure you've installed pygame: `pip install pygame`
   - Try: `python -m pip install pygame`

2. **Display issues or black screen**
   - Update your graphics drivers
   - Try running in windowed mode (games are already configured for this)

3. **Sound not working**
   - Sound is optional in these games
   - Check your system volume settings
   - The games will run without sound if audio initialization fails

4. **Performance issues**
   - Close other applications
   - Try reducing the window size in the code
   - Update pygame: `pip install --upgrade pygame`

## 📚 Educational Benefits

- **STEM Learning**: Introduction to physics, mathematics, and engineering concepts
- **Problem Solving**: Develops logical thinking through interactive gameplay
- **Visual Learning**: Complex concepts presented in visual, easy-to-understand format
- **Motor Skills**: Games like Duck Collection improve hand-eye coordination
